this is code i wrote
to show those people
that they don't know
what they're talking about.

here is that javascript code.

1. pull-suite.html pulls files from a small .epub i created.

2. pull-dollar.html pulls files from a bigger feedbooks .epub.

3. pull-pgmoby.html pulls files from the project gutenberg .epub of moby dick, a big .epub.

4. show-pgmoby.html actually displays the files pulled from the moby dick .epub.
