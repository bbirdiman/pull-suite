this is code i wrote
to show some people
that they don't know
what they're talking about.

it's the first draft
of something that will
become bigger, if i do it,
so don't bother forking it
or submitting pull requests,
or whatever you guys do...

just take it and use it.
unless your company 
or your parent company,
is now, or has ever been,
listed on the fortune 500,
because corporate scum
aren't allowed to use this code.
or even look at it. just go away.

props to the people
who wrote jszip...
